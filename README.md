## 🧠 It just *knows*

The next time you open that page, GlowMarkr will automatically re-apply your highlights. It's perfect for:

*   **Studying:** Keep track of key points in online articles.
*   **Shopping:** Highlight features of products you're comparing.
*   **Reading:** Mark your favorite quotes or important passages.

## 💖 Why you'll love it

*   **Super simple:** No complicated settings or buttons.
*   **It's persistent:** Your highlights are saved automatically and are there when you come back.
*   **It's free!**

## ⚠️ A Quick Heads-Up

GlowMarkr works best on pages with static content, like articles, blog posts, and documentation.

However, it may not work as expected on highly dynamic websites where the content changes frequently or is loaded on the fly. For example, on websites like **Facebook**, **Gmail**, or **Reddit**, you might find that your highlights don't reappear consistently.
